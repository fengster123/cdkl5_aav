i want to save different aav research on cdkl5's data into one place, then i can try to compare like for like, if possible

attached are two research, for each research, for watever data and method they produce, can you produce them into a meta data eg in dictionary format (in python), so i can copy and paste them into my module, and then i will do comparisons after i adjust them

put everything into one big dictionary, for each resaarch paper....and if possible the keys should be consistent across the research, so i can compare easil.y
